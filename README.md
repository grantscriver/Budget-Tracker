## Description:

This app allows users to track their spending history by allowing them to add or subtract their funds. It will track the total based off what the user enters and display their earning and spending history over time using a graph. If a user is online and then goes offline they will still be able to add entries that will be stored offline and then written to the database when they go back online.
